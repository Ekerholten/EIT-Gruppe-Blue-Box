\section{Milestones}
In order to keep the progress of the project steady, we decided we should define some milestones, to help give some perspective on how far we had gotten and how much remained to be done. This was also in the teamwork agreement, and it was one of the first things we did after we finished with the agreement.

The first milestone was to have our project definition ready to be handed in, and the components we would need to be ordered and on their way. This was scheduled for 13th of February. 

The next milestone was to connect the box to the ground station, so we could start the testing. Since the blue-box project later tanked we moved this milestone, to the 20th of Mars.

the last two milestones we set up for this project was to finish testing, and to finish the report, on the 17th and 24th of april, respectively.
