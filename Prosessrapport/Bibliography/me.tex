\subsection{Marius Ekerholt}

My name is Marius Ekerholt, in 2009 i started studying computer science at NTNU in Trondheim. I chose to  specialize in artificial Intelligence. Since 2012 i have been working for a development company. I have alot of exsperience in developmenting systems on web and mobile. I am good at finding solutions and i like working in groups. In this project i can see myself contributeing with technical insight and resolving different problems the group encounter. 
I chose this village because i have a generel interest in space and the technical aspect of it. I also looked forward to working with something outside my everyday activities. Besides the variation i also thought that the most important focus for EIT was to learn to work in groups with unfamiliar faces. I looked forward to meet new people with different background and work as a team despite our differences. I hope to gain new knowledge about different group processes and some knowlege about sattelites. I will do i best to make EIT an exciting project.
