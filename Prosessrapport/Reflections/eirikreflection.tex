\subsection{Eirik}
At the start of this process report I wrote that I thought the team process part of EiT would mostly be formalizing things I already knew. I wasn't very positive to the course based on things I'd heard beforehand. When we're now approaching the end of the project period I have discovered that there are many interesting aspects to the team process, and while it does actually formalize alot of things, these are thing I wouldn't think about without this course. Specifically this is the importance of the group dynamics and how decisions are made, and not just the groups total competence, when it comes to the final product of the project. I have become more aware of my own role inside a team, and how the way I act affects the group, and also what the others does and doesn't do, and how this affects the group. I have become better at giving personal reflections to my group members and about my group members.

I also feel this group has worked exceptionally well together, maybe even too well, considering we had no major conflicts, and agreed on mostly all decisions. 

Personally I found the lectures on group psychology very interesting, and while the conflict part of these lectures didn't apply very much to our group, I recognized elements from other groups I've been part of, which really helped me realize the importance of knowing about this a bit more formally.
