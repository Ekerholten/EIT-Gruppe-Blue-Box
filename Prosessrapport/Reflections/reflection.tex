At the end of the project the group sat down to reflect on the experiences and teamwork done during the project. We all came into the project with different expectations and academic background. We had all heard different things about the course, but we all had the impression that there would be potential conflicts and a lot of team exercises. The group had a wide variety in terms of academic background, and the project we chose to do allowed for using the skills of everyone on the team, and we had good communication and discussions where people showed their point of view, with no one being too quiet. 

The group had a good social tone from the beginning, and everybody agreed on most decisions, or we discussed it and reached a decision. This meant that the group had fun during the project, but we didn't get any larger conflicts, and therefore no more hands-on experience with conflict solving.
