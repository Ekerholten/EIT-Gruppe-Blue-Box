\subsection{Hanne}

My name is Hanne, I am studying Energy and Environmental engineering with specialization Energy and Heat Processes. This means that I have general knowledge about different renewable energy sources, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, gas processing and energy processrs. When I choose village for EiT I wanted to challenge myself by choosing something new and unfamiliar. The NUTS Stident Satellite seemed incredibly exciting. But by challenging myself with a topic outside my study I became unsure how to apply my knowledge. I received mixed feedback about EiT from previous students. Many expressed that it was time consuming and that working in interdisciplinary groups were demanding. Taking this to consideration I expected that EiT would be challenging but with my choice of the village it would give me knowledge about something new. Regarding the interdisciplinary collaboration my expectations were both positive and negative. I looked forward to meeting new people with different backgrounds, but were unsure whether the group would mangage to work together.
