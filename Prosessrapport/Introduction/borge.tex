\subsection{Børge}

My name is Børge Irgens. I study theoretical physics at NTNU with primary focus on quantum entanglement. The reason I chose this EiT village is my interest in space physics and technology. My specialization is not strictly relevant to the work I do in this course, but my skills in analyzing physical systems (e.g. satellite orbits) and mathematics in general has been useful.

I've heard mixed reviews from other students about EiT, e.g. some people had problems with conflicts with other group members. This meant that I came into this project with kind of low expectations, but luckily it seems that everyone wants to do well on this course. Now I'm looking forward to hopefully learning a lot about both teamwork and satellites.
