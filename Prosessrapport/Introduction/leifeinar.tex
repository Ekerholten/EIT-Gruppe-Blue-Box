\subsection{Leif-Einar}
I have an education in electronics service and are now studying electronics at NTNU. In my studies I have specialized in radio and digital communication including satellite communication. 

My expectations for EIT is that we will get continuous feedback on how we work together as a team. Because of this I believe that the team eventually will work good together.
