%This is an example reference to a bibliography item: \cite{eksempel-bib-item}
This chapter will contain a short introduction to our project. That means what we're doing and what people are working on the project. It will also be discussed some short background on why we're doing this project.
\section{The Project group}
The project group consisted of 6 people from 5 different studies, so we had a wide variety of competence to use in the project. The group members can be seen in \autoref{tab:groupmembers}. Since most of our group members study technology, we decided to make something physical, and not just theorize.
