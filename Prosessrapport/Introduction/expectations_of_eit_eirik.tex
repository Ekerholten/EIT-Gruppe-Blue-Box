\subsection{Eirik}
My expectations of EiT was that it seemed like formalizing things one already knew a lot, and that by extension it was quite boring and dull, with a lot of dead time where the group did nothing. That being said, I felt that the village was interesting, and I was looking forward to the project, while I also hoped that this would give me a chance to work with people from different fields and while I thought it might feel a little forced and formalized, give me a chance to improve my teamworking abilities, and my conflict solving skills.
