\subsection{Hallstein Skjølsvik}
My name is Hallstein Skjølsvik. I started to to study electrical engineering in 2009 at HiST (Høgskolen i Sør-Trøndelag). I completed my bachelor degree in the spring 2012. The same autumn I started a two year master program in electronics at NTNU. At NTNU I specialize within design of digital circuits. In addition to studying I have been working part time as a shift leader at a grocery store until 2012. After I completed my bachelor degree I got a part time job at Konsberg Seatex, where I work with maritime electronics. Therefore do I have some experience with working in a team. 
	I chose the NUTS village at EiT because I always have been fascinated by space exploration. A student satellite seems like an interesting project where I can learn something which in is not normally covered by the digital design masters program. My expectations to this project is to learn more about the process of launching a satellite in to space. In addition I hope to get in touch with people from a different field of study, but with similar interests as me.
