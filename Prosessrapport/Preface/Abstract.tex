\section*{Abstract}

The subject Experts in Teamwork builds on learning about interdisciplinary team collaboration. Our group consists of six people with different backgrounds. We will categorize us as a heterogeneous group despite that we all study at NTNU Gl√∏shaugen. To use the different knowledge within the group we had a strong focus on shaping the task so that everyone can participate with their knowledge. Since no one had great background knowledge of the project's theme, it was natural for us to have a flat structure without any designated leader. 

To identify the group development and progress, various events and process exercises has been discussed and evaluated. As a team we have solved conflicts, reached consensus when changing the project definition and achieved better self-awareness and openness through process exercises. When we met challenges where the group had difficulties to cooperate or were unproductive, we used different theory to solve this in a good way.  
After working together for a while we got a good friendship that led to more openness and better communication. We also had a lot of fun during the working period. 

From this experience we all learned something about us selves and how we affect the group dynamic.  We also experienced how to cope with challenges and discuss undiscussable issues.
