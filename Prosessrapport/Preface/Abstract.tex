\section*{Abstract}

This report is a part of the result of Experts in Teamwork village TFE4850 Student Satellite, spring 2013. EiT is a interdisciplinary course, where the students from different study programs work together to acheieve a common goal. It is important to use the different knowledge in constructiv manner and work well together under pressure to achiece effectivity and reach our goal. 

An important part of this course is to focus on how the group work together and communicates internally. This is a report that describes this process, and we emphasize individual situations which we believe has been of great importance to the group collaboration. We have focused on using relevant theory and joint reflection to create an understanding of what happened,  what we could have done differently and how to improve the process on this basis. We will also try to locate patterns of behavior that affects the group work. 

Our project has the problem definition "Examine the possibility and usefulness of a groundstation network with emphasis on Carpcomm" (bare skrev noe her). We have tried to connect the ground station at NTNU up to Carpcom Space Newtwork and investegated whether this is profitable and possible.
