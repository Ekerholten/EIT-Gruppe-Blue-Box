\section{Further Work}
As it is now Carpcomm can not be combined with our own usage of the antennas and radio. It is fairly simple to implement code to upload data to Carpcomm, then we will be able to control the radio and antennas as we wish and still upload data to the network when where not using the radio ourselves. This will also let us use the big radio rig instead of the small radios that Carpcomm supports.

If the Carpcomm software shall be used, the rotor control should be looked in to. It is probably necessary to make an modification to carpsd or to the driver for the rotor interface.

The existing rotor interface have some quirks that makes the movement very choppy which can be bad for the antennas and rotors. Because of this it is desirable with a new rotor interface. The Raspberry Pi have the necessary inputs and outputs to act as an interface, it only needs some voltage converters and some software to control it.
