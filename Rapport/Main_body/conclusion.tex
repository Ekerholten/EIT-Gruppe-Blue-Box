\section{Conclusion}
The Carpcomm software are easy to install and set up, as long as the radio are supported. The supported radios are all small and inexpensive, which makes them suitable for radio amateurs who want to help with receiving satellite transmissions. These smaller radios can only use one antenna, and since only one radio can be used Carpcomm can only receive either UHF or VHF signals. Unfortunately this makes it less suitable for us, since we want to use our bigger radio which is not supported.

Since we could not get the software to control the antenna rotors we can only receive data from satellites in an small area of the sky, which makes the station less useful.

Carpcomm is only suitable for data that can be transmitted continuously. Since the Carpcomm network can't be used to transmit to the satellites it is impossible to tell the satellite that it should send it's data.

Carpcomm are suitable for amateurs who wants an inexpensive way to help the micro satellite community. For professional usage it lacks important features and hardware compatibility.
