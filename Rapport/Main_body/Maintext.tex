\chapter{Ground Station Networks}
%This chapter will present the different technologies, theory behind the reasoning for having multiple ground stations listen to our satellite and calculations on sufficient power supply. 

This chapter will present the some theory and simulations regarding ground station networks and power supply. Different network technologies are also presented and our solution is presented.

%Before we started our project, we did quite a lot of prestudy, covering which technology was available, to determine which fit our project best. This chapter will contain a summary of the different technologies, and also some theory behind the reasoning for having multiple ground stations listen to our satellite.

\paragraph{Why we chose Carpcomm}
After exploring the different alternatives, BlueBox seemed to be a good choice. However this would require some support from Aalborg University. This was impossible, as they were busy with a satellite launch of their own. Carpcomm Space Network is a network of ground stations that already have participants. This network is actually up and running and all the necessary resources are available at their home page. We wanted to test this ground station network without interfering with the system already in place. The solution was to use a Raspberry pi to connect the ground station at Gløshaugen to the Carpcomm Space Network.

\section {Connecting to the Network}

To connect the ground station to the Carpcomm Space Network the Carpcomm software was installed. The CarpSD ground station control software used is an open-source program primarily developed by the team behind Carpcomm. The purpose of this software is to make it possible to connect to the Carpcomm server. It also makes it possible to control the ground station if you have access to a web-browser. This is possible because the software runs a background process on the Raspberry Pi. The software runs continuously in the background making is possible to connect to at any time and start receiving from satellites.

Further an entry for our station, plotting the latitude, longitude and elevation, were created. 
Since the Raspberry didn‚Äôt have a connector for the box that controls the antenna a cable had to be made so that the two components could communicate. (image) 
This cable led to some challenges since it wasn't robust enough, and if there had been more time a new and stronger cable would have been made. Before starting testing the software controlling the antenna had to be installed. Hamblib rotator library was chosen since the rotator used supports it. 

With everything set the testing of the station could start. The testing was started of with connecting to a small TV-antenna to register the signal. On the station page at the Carpcomm website the frequency was set to 433.3 MHz. The reason for this frequency is because it used by the police in Trondheim, and there are likely to be a lot of transmissions there. Data was successfully received and publish to the Carpcomm Space Network.

A short explanation of the recorded transmission. The x-axis is the frequency and the y-axis it time. Black and gray is noise and the white left of the yellow line is signals.

After receiving data from the TV-antenna, a full-scale antenna was used. The Carpcomm software succeeded in receiving data, but the automated rotor control did not work. This is a problem that remains unsolved and must be worked on further. Another problem is that the Carpcomm software only supports receiving data, not sending. This means that one must command the satellite to start transmitting, and some other solution must consequently be devised.
