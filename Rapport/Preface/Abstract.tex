The NTNU Test Satellite will be using amateur radio and will therefore have a very limited transfer rate of 9600 bps. Combined with the limited access time to the satellite this means a very limited 600 kB of data can be downloaded per day. 

The aim of this project was to consider some possible networks and set up a ground station network at the student ground station here at Gløshaugen. 

We have set up a Raspberry Pi as a ground station and connected it to the Carpcomm Space Network. However we've found that it lacks support for many kinds of radios and the rotor control functionality is still experimental. And in addition it can't transmit to the satellite, so it can't be used to initiate downloads. Our simulations show that even a small network will drastically increase the amount of data that can be downloaded, so if these challenges can be overcome the improvements can be substantial.
