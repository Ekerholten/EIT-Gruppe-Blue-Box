The NTNU Test Satellite will be using amateur radio and will therefore have a very limited transfer rate of 9600 bps. Combined with the limited access time to the satellite this means a limited amount of data can be downloaded per day. 

The aim of this project was to consider some possible networks and set up a ground station network at the student ground station here at Gløshaugen.
