\section*{Abstract}
This project aimed to create and test a BlueBox, an USB-driven ground station, developed for AAUSAT3 by Aalborg University to send and recieve signals from satelites. The NUTS project have a problem with low transfer rate between the single ground station at the university and the satelite, and by setting up a network of BlueBoxes at different ground stations around the globe, we can increase the time which the satelite is available for data transfering.

Since setting up the network proved too time consuming, we set as our goal to make a BlueBox, and test that it can recieve signals from a satelite, and in this way make it easier for others to set up the network, in that they already have documentation on how to set up and configure each indiviual ground station.
