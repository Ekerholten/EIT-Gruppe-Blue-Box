\section{Raspberry pi}
Raspberry Pi is a small computer, with everything gathered in one board. In our project we will be using the B model, revition 2, which have a 700MHz ARM CPU, 512MB of RAM and a SC-card reader, in addition to the leads to connect to different devices, for  the full overview, see figure \ref{fig:raspberrypihighlevel}. The recommended operating system is Raspbian, a linux distribution based on Debian. 

The Raspberry pi was originally intended to help teach programming, but it can also perform many of the standard computer tasks, and it can be connected to a monitor or tv using an HDMI lead. In our project we hope to be able to use a Raspberry pi to run the software required to control the ground stations. The software provided by the carpcomm project has Raspbian as one of its supported plattforms, so we hope this will work well.
