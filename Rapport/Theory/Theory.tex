\chapter{Theory}
Before we started our project, we did quite alot of prestudy, covering which technology was available, to determine which fit our project best. This chapter will contain a summary of the different technologies, and also some theory behind the reasoning for having multiple ground stations listen to our satellite.

\section{Network technology for ground stations}
When we decided to work on a network of ground stations, we first looked into four different ground station network technologies. We first hoped to work on a BlueBox, but this would require support from Aalborg that we couldn't get, as they were busy with a satellite launch of their own. Because of this, we decided to look into Carpcomm, that seemed more complete and doable than connecting to PYXIS with a BlueBox.
