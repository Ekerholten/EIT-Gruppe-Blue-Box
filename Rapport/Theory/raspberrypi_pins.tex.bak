To control the movement of the antennas, an serial port is needed. Raspberry Pi has an serial port included in its gpio (general purpose input/output) connector. This serial port uses ttl-standard for its voltage levels, this is 0/3.3V while RS232 which is the standard used in computers uses (3V-15V)/-(3V-15V). Because of this an converter is needed. We chose to make an custom circuit board using the MAX3232 RS232 line driver
