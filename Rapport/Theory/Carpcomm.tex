\subsection{Carpcomm Space Network}
Carpcomm is a private company that delivers a plug and play ground station \cite{carpcomm-gs1} that costs \$700. The software for the ground station is open source and is provided precompiled for x86 and arm processors.
CarpSD, the software from Carpcomm connects to an server where it can upload data from satellites. From an web interface at this server the groundstation can also be controlled remotely, it can also be set up to control the groundstation automatically.
%It is compatible with the Carpcomm Space Network \cite{carpcomm-sn}. 
The advantage of using this solution is that the network is actually functioning, though there are few other operational ground stations.
