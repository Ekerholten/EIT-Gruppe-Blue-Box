\subsection{Carpcomm Space Network}
Carpcomm is a private company that delivers a plug and play ground station \cite{carpcomm-gs1} that costs $700. The software for the ground station is open source and is provided pre.compiled for x86 and arm debian.
It is compatible with the Carpcomm Space Network \cite{carpcomm-sn}. 
The advantage of using this solution is that the network is actually functioning, though there are few other operational ground stations.
